# Java-Homework

Created a linked list with a linkedList of vertices
Each vertice has a list of edges which point to other vertices
Did not get to determine connectivity but can discuss this in a future interview
I will also be prepared to answer other questions on assignment (edges to have direction, edges to have labels, etc)
